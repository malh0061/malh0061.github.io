            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I am a student at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> who is passionate about learning new technologies and improving my creative skills.
                I enjoy working with web design and development because it allows me to combine logic with creativity.
                Over the past few years, I have developed an interest in digital media, storytelling, and problem-solving, which motivates me to constantly improve and grow.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of academics, I like exploring new ideas, experimenting with projects, and learning from real-world experiences.
                I believe consistency and discipline are the keys to success, especially in today’s fast-changing world.
                My goal is to keep learning every day and become better than I was yesterday, even if the progress feels small at first.
            </p>
